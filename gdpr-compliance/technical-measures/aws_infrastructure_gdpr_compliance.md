# AWS Infrastructure GDPR Compliance

This document outlines how our AWS infrastructure implements technical measures to comply with GDPR requirements.

## 1. Infrastructure Overview

Our Internet Banking Application is deployed on AWS using a microservices architecture with the following key components:

- **Networking**: VPC with public and private subnets across multiple availability zones
- **Compute**: ECS services for microservices deployment
- **Storage**: RDS databases, ElastiCache, S3 buckets
- **Security**: WAF, Security Groups, IAM policies
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch, CloudTrail
- **CI/CD**: CodeBuild, ECR repositories

## 2. GDPR Technical Requirements Implementation

### 2.1 Data Protection by Design and Default (Article 25)

#### VPC Network Segmentation
- Private subnets for all data processing components
- Public subnets only for load balancers and bastion hosts
- Network ACLs and security groups restricting traffic
- Three availability zones for high availability

#### Security Groups
- Principle of least privilege access
- Specific port-level access controls
- Service-to-service communication restrictions

#### WAF Implementation
- Protection against common web exploits
- Geographic restrictions where appropriate
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

### 2.2 Security of Processing (Article 32)

#### Encryption at Rest
- RDS databases with encryption enabled (AWS KMS)
- S3 buckets with server-side encryption
- ElastiCache with encryption
- EBS volumes with encryption

#### Encryption in Transit
- TLS for all external communications
- TLS for internal service-to-service communication
- Secure API endpoints with TLS 1.2+

#### Access Controls
- IAM roles with least privilege
- Multi-factor authentication for AWS Console access
- Role-based access control
- Session timeout and rotation policies

#### Monitoring and Logging
- CloudWatch logs for all services
- CloudTrail audit logging
- VPC Flow Logs for network traffic analysis
- WAF logging for security events
- Log retention policies aligned with data retention requirements

### 2.3 Data Subject Rights Implementation

#### Right to Access and Portability (Articles 15 & 20)
- Data export capabilities in JSON format
- APIs to retrieve personal data
- Database queries designed to retrieve all user-related data

#### Right to Erasure (Article 17)
- Data deletion workflows
- Database cascade delete functionality
- S3 bucket lifecycle policies
- RDS backup retention policies

#### Right to Rectification (Article 16)
- User profile management APIs
- Database update procedures
- Audit trails for data changes

### 2.4 Data Breach Notification Capabilities (Article 33 & 34)

#### Detection
- CloudWatch alarms for abnormal activities
- GuardDuty for threat detection
- Security Hub for compliance monitoring
- Custom monitoring for sensitive data access

#### Response
- SNS notifications for security events
- Lambda functions for automated responses
- Defined incident response workflow

#### Containment
- Ability to isolate affected services
- Network traffic control mechanisms
- Emergency access revocation procedures

## 3. Specific AWS Service Configurations for GDPR Compliance

### 3.1 Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL & MySQL)

- **Encryption**: AWS KMS with customer-managed keys
- **Backup**: Automated backups with 7-day retention
- **Deletion**: Procedures for secure data deletion
- **Access**: IAM authentication and database-level access controls
- **Monitoring**: Enhanced monitoring and Performance Insights
- **Patching**: Automated minor version updates

### 3.2 Amazon S3

- **Encryption**: Server-side encryption with KMS
- **Access Control**: Bucket policies and IAM policies
- **Public Access**: Block all public access enabled
- **Lifecycle Policies**: Data retention and transition rules
- **Versioning**: Enabled for accidental deletion protection
- **Logging**: Access logging enabled

### 3.3 Amazon ECS/Containers

- **Secrets Management**: AWS Secrets Manager for sensitive data
- **Image Security**: ECR image scanning
- **Container Isolation**: Security groups at task level
- **Logging**: CloudWatch log configuration
- **Resource Limits**: Memory and CPU constraints

### 3.4 AWS WAF

- **Rule Sets**: OWASP Top 10 protection
- **IP Blocking**: Geo-restriction capabilities
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent brute force attacks
- **Custom Rules**: Application-specific protections
- **Logging**: Full logging of security events

### 3.5 CloudWatch and Monitoring

- **Log Retention**: Configurable retention periods
- **Log Encryption**: Encryption of log data
- **Metrics**: Performance and security metrics
- **Alarms**: Automated alerts for security events
- **Dashboard**: Security monitoring dashboard

## 4. Data Processor Agreements and Third-Party Services

All AWS services used in our infrastructure are covered by the AWS GDPR Data Processing Addendum. For each additional third-party service integrated with our AWS infrastructure, we maintain:

- Signed Data Processing Agreements
- Security assessment documentation
- Data flow mapping
- Transfer mechanism documentation

## 5. International Data Transfers

Our infrastructure is primarily hosted in the [REGION] AWS region. For any cross-region data transfers:

- We use AWS private network connections
- We encrypt all data in transit
- We maintain appropriate transfer mechanisms under GDPR
- We document all data flows in our data mapping

## 6. Data Protection Impact Assessment Results

Based on our Data Protection Impact Assessment:

- High-risk processing activities are identified
- Technical mitigations are implemented
- Residual risks are managed and documented
- Regular reassessment is scheduled

## 7. Regular Security Assessment

Our AWS infrastructure undergoes:

- Quarterly vulnerability assessments
- Annual penetration testing
- Continuous compliance monitoring
- Regular security configuration reviews

## 8. Documentation and Compliance Evidence

We maintain the following documentation as evidence of GDPR compliance:

- Infrastructure architecture diagrams
- AWS Config rules and compliance reports
- Security control implementation details
- Change management logs
- Security incident reports
