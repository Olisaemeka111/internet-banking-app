## Data Minimization

All systems and processes must implement data minimization principles:

1. Collect only necessary data for the stated purpose
2. Store data only for as long as required
3. Implement automatic deletion or anonymization of data once retention periods expire
4. Regularly review and update retention requirements

## Technical Implementation

### Deletion Methods

1. **Automated Deletion**: Systems should automatically delete or anonymize data that has reached its retention limit
2. **Anonymization**: Where data must be kept for statistical purposes beyond the retention period, it must be anonymized
3. **Secure Deletion**: All deletion must ensure data cannot be recovered

### Backup and Archive Considerations

1. Backups must respect retention periods
2. Archived data must be searchable to fulfill data subject requests
3. Deletion from live systems must propagate to backups and archives within a reasonable timeframe

## Exceptions

1. **Legal Hold**: Data subject to legal hold will be exempt from regular deletion until the hold is released
2. **Disputes**: Data related to ongoing disputes will be retained until resolution plus the regular retention period
3. **Regulatory Investigations**: Data related to regulatory investigations will be retained until completion plus the regular retention period

## Responsibilities

- **Data Protection Officer**: Oversight of this policy and regular reviews
- **IT Department**: Implementation of technical controls for retention and deletion
- **Legal Department**: Advising on legal requirements and managing legal holds
- **Department Managers**: Ensuring compliance within their areas of responsibility

## Review

This policy will be reviewed annually or when there are significant changes to regulatory requirements.
