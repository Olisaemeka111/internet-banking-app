3. How will you implement data minimization?
4. What retention period is appropriate?
5. How will you secure the data?
6. What user controls and transparency measures will you implement?
7. How will you handle data subject rights?
8. Is a DPIA required for this feature?

Present your design to the larger group, highlighting privacy features.

**Discussion Questions:**
- How does considering privacy from the beginning change the design process?
- What are the business benefits of privacy by design?
- What challenges did you encounter when applying these principles?

Complete the following assessment:
1. What data protection questions should be asked before sharing data?

4. What customer transparency and consent requirements apply?
5. How should ongoing compliance be monitored?

**Discussion Questions:**

4. Mobile app registration (requests access to contacts, location, photos, and other device data)
5. Online banking profile (collects detailed preference information and browsing behavior)

For each example, create a revised version that collects only necessary data.

**Discussion Questions:**
- How do we determine what data is "necessary" for a purpose?
- What are the benefits of collecting less data?
- How does data minimization reduce risk?
