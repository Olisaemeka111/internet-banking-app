## Variable Costs Not Included in Baseline
- **Data Transfer**: Can significantly increase costs, especially for:
  - Internet egress traffic
  - Cross-AZ traffic
  - Data processing through NAT Gateways
- **CloudWatch Logs**: Ingest costs ($0.50/GB) and storage
- **CodeBuild Minutes**: Based on build frequency and duration
- **S3 Storage and Requests**: Depends on artifact size and frequency
- **Lambda Invocations**: For security notifications

## Infrastructure Components Overview

The infrastructure consists of:

1. **Microservices Architecture**:
   - 9 microservices deployed as ECS services
   - API Gateway, Config Server, Service Registry
   - Core Banking, User Service, Fund Transfer, Utility Payment
   - Supporting services (Keycloak for auth, Zipkin for tracing)

2. **High Availability**:
   - Multi-AZ deployment (3 Availability Zones)
   - Load balancers for traffic distribution
   - NAT Gateways in each AZ

3. **Security**:
   - WAF protection for web traffic
   - Security scanning through CodeBuild
   - VPC with proper segmentation
   - CloudWatch monitoring and alerting

4. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - CodeBuild projects for each service
   - ECR repositories for container storage
   - S3 buckets for artifact storage

## Cost Optimization Recommendations

### Development/Staging Environments
1. **Reduce NAT Gateways**: Use 1 NAT Gateway instead of 3 (saves ~$65/month per environment)
2. **Smaller Database Instances**: Use t3.small instead of t3.medium (saves ~$50/month per environment)
3. **Reduce ECS Resources**: Scale down memory/CPU for non-critical services
4. **Shared Load Balancers**: Consolidate load balancers where possible

### Production Optimizations
1. **Reserved Instances**: For RDS, ElastiCache, and potentially ECS (can save 30-60%)
2. **Savings Plans**: For steady-state ECS workloads (can save 30-72%)
3. **Auto-scaling**: Ensure proper scaling policies to reduce costs during low traffic
4. **CloudWatch Log Retention**: Set appropriate retention periods

## Long-term Cost Management
1. **Set Up AWS Budgets**: Create alerts for unexpected spending
2. **Regular Rightsizing**: Review resource utilization and adjust sizing
3. **Cost Allocation Tags**: Tag resources properly for cost tracking
4. **Regular Reviews**: Analyze cost reports monthly to identify optimization opportunities

## Potential Annual Savings
- **Environment Optimization**: ~$115/month x 2 environments = $2,760/year
- **Reserved Instances/Savings Plans**: ~30% of $2,276/month = $8,193/year
- **Total Potential Savings**: ~$10,950/year (23% reduction)

## Future Growth Considerations
- **Traffic Scaling**: Additional costs for increased data transfer and request volume
- **Storage Growth**: Increasing database and S3 storage needs over time
- **New Features**: Additional microservices and infrastructure components
- **Backup & DR**: Additional costs for enhanced data protection requirements

## Conclusion
The AWS Internet Banking Infrastructure provides a robust, scalable, and secure platform at a reasonable cost of $3,923 per month. With the recommended optimizations, this could be reduced to approximately $3,000 per month without sacrificing reliability or performance, representing a significant cost advantage over on-premises alternatives while maintaining enterprise-grade security and compliance capabilities.
