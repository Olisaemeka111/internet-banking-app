# AWS Deployment Plan for Internet Banking Microservices Project

## 1. AWS Architecture Overview

The deployment will leverage several AWS services to create a robust, scalable, and secure environment:

- **Amazon ECS/EKS**: For container orchestration
- **Amazon RDS**: For MySQL and PostgreSQL databases
- **Amazon ElastiCache**: For caching
- **AWS API Gateway**: For API management
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: For monitoring and logging
- **AWS Secrets Manager**: For secure credential management
- **AWS Certificate Manager**: For SSL/TLS certificates
- **Amazon Route 53**: For DNS management
- **AWS WAF**: For web application firewall protection
- **Amazon VPC**: For network isolation

## 2. Detailed Deployment Components

### 2.1 Networking Layer

1. **VPC Setup**:
   - Create a VPC with multiple Availability Zones (at least 2)
   - Configure public and private subnets
   - Set up NAT Gateways for outbound internet access from private subnets
   - Implement Network ACLs and Security Groups

2. **DNS Configuration**:
   - Set up Route 53 for domain management
   - Create hosted zones for internal service discovery

### 2.2 Container Orchestration

1. **ECS/EKS Cluster**:
   - Deploy an ECS or EKS cluster across multiple Availability Zones
   - For ECS: Use Fargate for serverless container management
   - For EKS: Configure node groups with auto-scaling

2. **Service Definitions**:
   - Define each microservice as a separate ECS service or Kubernetes deployment:
     - Core Banking Service
     - User Service
     - Fund Transfer Service
     - Utility Payment Service
     - API Gateway
     - Service Registry
     - Config Server
   - Configure appropriate CPU and memory allocations
   - Set up auto-scaling policies based on CPU/memory usage

### 2.3 Database Layer

1. **RDS Instances**:
   - Deploy MySQL Multi-AZ instance for core banking data
   - Deploy PostgreSQL Multi-AZ instance for Keycloak
   - Configure automated backups and point-in-time recovery
   - Implement read replicas for high-read workloads

2. **ElastiCache**:
   - Deploy Redis cluster for caching and session management
   - Configure Multi-AZ for high availability

### 2.4 Authentication & Security

1. **Keycloak Deployment**:
   - Deploy Keycloak on ECS/EKS with high availability
   - Configure connection to PostgreSQL RDS
   - Import existing realm configuration

2. **Secrets Management**:
   - Store database credentials, API keys, and Keycloak secrets in AWS Secrets Manager
   - Configure services to retrieve secrets at runtime

3. **SSL/TLS**:
   - Provision certificates through AWS Certificate Manager
   - Configure HTTPS for all external endpoints

### 2.5 Monitoring & Observability

1. **Distributed Tracing**:
   - Deploy Zipkin on ECS/EKS
   - Configure services to send traces to Zipkin

2. **Logging & Monitoring**:
   - Configure CloudWatch for centralized logging
   - Set up CloudWatch alarms for critical metrics
   - Create custom dashboards for service health monitoring

3. **Alerting**:
   - Configure SNS topics for alerting
   - Set up CloudWatch alarms to trigger notifications

## 3. Service Accessibility & Communication

### 3.1 External Access

1. **API Gateway**:
   - Deploy Application Load Balancer (ALB) in front of the API Gateway service
   - Configure SSL termination at the ALB
   - Set up WAF rules to protect against common web vulnerabilities

2. **Public Endpoints**:
   - Expose only the API Gateway to the public internet
   - All other services should be accessible only within the VPC

### 3.2 Service Discovery

1. **Replace Eureka with AWS Cloud Map**:
   - Migrate from Eureka to AWS Cloud Map for service discovery
   - Update service configurations to use Cloud Map endpoints

2. **Internal Communication**:
   - Configure services to communicate via internal DNS names
   - Implement service mesh (optional) using AWS App Mesh for advanced traffic management

### 3.3 Configuration Management

1. **Replace Config Server**:
   - Migrate from Spring Cloud Config Server to AWS AppConfig or Parameter Store
   - Update services to retrieve configuration from AWS services

## 4. CI/CD Pipeline

1. **AWS CodePipeline**:
   - Set up pipelines for each microservice
   - Configure source integration with GitHub
   - Implement build stage with AWS CodeBuild
   - Set up automated testing
   - Configure deployment to ECS/EKS

2. **Infrastructure as Code**:
   - Define all infrastructure using AWS CloudFormation or Terraform
   - Version control infrastructure definitions
   - Implement automated infrastructure deployment

## 5. Deployment Strategy

### 5.1 Migration Approach

1. **Database Migration**:
   - Set up RDS instances
   - Migrate data from existing databases
   - Validate data integrity

2. **Service Deployment**:
   - Deploy supporting services first (Keycloak, Config, Service Registry)
   - Deploy core services next
   - Deploy API Gateway last
   - Implement blue-green deployment for zero downtime

### 5.2 Testing Strategy

1. **Pre-Production Environment**:
   - Deploy complete stack in a staging environment
   - Perform integration testing
   - Conduct load testing to validate performance
   - Execute security scanning

2. **Production Deployment**:
   - Implement canary deployment for gradual traffic shifting
   - Monitor for any issues during deployment
   - Have rollback procedures ready

## 6. Cost Optimization

1. **Resource Sizing**:
   - Right-size containers based on actual usage patterns
   - Implement auto-scaling to handle variable loads

2. **Reserved Instances**:
   - Purchase reserved instances for predictable workloads
   - Use Savings Plans for ECS/EKS

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Set up AWS Cost Explorer for cost tracking
   - Implement tagging strategy for cost allocation

## 7. Security Considerations

1. **Data Protection**:
   - Encrypt data at rest using RDS encryption
   - Encrypt data in transit using TLS
   - Implement field-level encryption for sensitive data

2. **Access Control**:
   - Implement IAM roles for services
   - Follow principle of least privilege
   - Use IAM policies for fine-grained access control

3. **Compliance**:
   - Implement AWS Config rules for compliance monitoring
   - Set up AWS Security Hub for security posture management
   - Configure AWS GuardDuty for threat detection
