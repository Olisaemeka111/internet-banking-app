| **Right to Erasure** | Data deletion API (to be implemented) | ðŸ”„ In progress |
| **Records of Processing** | AWS Config and inventory tracking | âœ… After remediation |

## 3. Financial Services Regulations

| Requirement | Implementation | Status |
|-------------|---------------|--------|
| **Business Continuity** | Multi-AZ deployment, RDS multi-AZ | âœ… Compliant |

| **Strong Authentication** | Cognito with MFA, complex password policy | âœ… After remediation |
| **Fraud Prevention** | WAF rules, rate limiting, geo-restrictions | âœ… After remediation |

## 4. Technical Compliance Implementation

### Encryption Implementation

All sensitive data in the Internet Banking application is protected using AWS KMS:

```terraform
# Data at rest encryption
resource "aws_db_instance" "mysql" {
  storage_encrypted = true
  kms_key_id        = aws_kms_key.rds.arn
}

# Log encryption
resource "aws_cloudwatch_log_group" "example" {
  kms_key_id = aws_kms_key.logs.arn
}

# Secrets encryption
resource "aws_secretsmanager_secret" "db_credentials" {
  kms_key_id = aws_kms_key.secrets.arn
}
```

### Network Security Implementation

Traffic is restricted using security groups with least privilege:

```terraform
# Security group for API Gateway
resource "aws_security_group" "api_gateway" {
  # Only allow HTTPS inbound
  ingress {
    from_port   = 443
    to_port     = 443
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
  
  # Only allow specific outbound traffic
  egress {
    from_port       = 8081
    to_port         = 8082
    protocol        = "tcp"
    security_groups = [aws_security_group.ecs.id]
  }
}
```

### Authentication Implementation

Multi-factor authentication and strong password policies:

```terraform
resource "aws_cognito_user_pool" "main" {
  # Password policy
  password_policy {
    minimum_length    = 12
    require_lowercase = true
    require_numbers   = true
    require_symbols   = true
    require_uppercase = true
  }
  
  # MFA configuration
  mfa_configuration = "OPTIONAL"
  
  # Advanced security features
  user_pool_add_ons {
    advanced_security_mode = "ENFORCED"
  }
}
```

### Container Security Implementation

Hardened container configurations:

```json
{
  "containerDefinitions": [{
    "readonlyRootFilesystem": true,
    "privileged": false,
    "user": "1000:1000",
    "linuxParameters": {
      "capabilities": {
        "drop": ["ALL"],
        "add": ["NET_BIND_SERVICE"]
      }
    }
  }]
}
```

## 5. Continuous Compliance Monitoring

The Internet Banking application implements continuous compliance monitoring:

1. **AWS Config Rules** - Automated checks for compliance drift
2. **CloudWatch Alarms** - Real-time alerts for security events
3. **Security Scanning** - Regular automated scans with tfsec and checkov
4. **Penetration Testing** - Quarterly third-party penetration tests
5. **Compliance Audits** - Biannual compliance audits

## 6. Compliance Documentation and Evidence

The following documentation is maintained for compliance evidence:

1. **Security Design Documents** - Architecture diagrams with security controls
2. **Risk Assessments** - Regular security risk assessments
3. **Audit Logs** - Retained according to regulatory requirements
4. **Incident Response Plan** - Procedures for security incidents
5. **Training Records** - Security awareness training for developers

## 7. Conclusion

After implementing the security remediation plan, the Internet Banking application infrastructure meets the key requirements for PCI DSS, GDPR, and financial services regulations. Continuous monitoring and regular security assessments ensure ongoing compliance.

The remaining tasks to achieve full compliance include:
1. Implementing data portability APIs for GDPR compliance
2. Enhancing the incident response automation
3. Completing the multi-region disaster recovery implementation

These items are scheduled in Phase 2 of the remediation roadmap.
