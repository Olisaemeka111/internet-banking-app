# Security Findings Response Procedure

## Purpose

This document outlines the procedure for responding to security findings discovered during the CI/CD pipeline execution for the Internet Banking application. It establishes a standardized process for triaging, remediating, and documenting security issues identified by automated scanning tools.

## Scope

This procedure applies to all security findings discovered in:

- Source code scanning
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Container image scanning
- Infrastructure-as-code scanning
- Cloud configuration scanning
- Compliance verification

## Severity Classification

Security findings are classified by severity to determine the appropriate response timeline and escalation path:

| Severity Level | Description | Response Time | Approval for Exception |
|----------------|-------------|---------------|------------------------|
| Critical | Findings that could lead to immediate compromise, data breach, or system failure | 24 hours | CISO |
| High | Significant vulnerabilities that could lead to system compromise | 3 business days | Security Director |
| Medium | Moderate risk vulnerabilities that don't pose immediate threat | 10 business days | Security Manager |
| Low | Minor issues with minimal impact | 30 business days | Team Lead |

## Response Procedure

### 1. Initial Notification

When security findings are discovered during pipeline execution:

1. The pipeline will automatically generate a notification to the security team via SNS
2. The notification will include:
   - Build/deployment ID
   - Repository and branch information
   - Summary of findings by severity
   - Link to detailed reports

### 2. Triage and Assessment

The security team will perform an initial assessment within the following timeframes:

- Critical: Immediate (within 1 hour during business hours, 4 hours outside business hours)
- High: Within 4 business hours
- Medium: Within 1 business day
- Low: Within 3 business days

Assessment will include:

1. Validation of finding accuracy (true/false positive)
2. Impact assessment
3. Exploitability assessment
4. Assignment of final severity rating

### 3. Documentation

All validated security findings must be documented in the security tracking system (Jira) with the following information:

- Finding ID (generated by scanning tool)
- Severity classification
- Affected component(s)
- Technical description
- Potential impact
- Remediation deadline
- Assigned owner

### 4. Remediation

The development team will remediate security findings according to the specified timeline based on severity:

1. Create a fix branch from the affected branch
2. Implement the necessary changes
3. Submit the changes for peer review
4. Run the security scan locally to verify the fix
5. Create a pull request for review

### 5. Verification

After remediation is implemented:

1. The pipeline will automatically run security scans on the fix branch
2. The security team will verify that findings have been properly addressed
3. Documentation will be updated with remediation details

### 6. Exceptions

If a security finding cannot be remediated within the required timeframe, an exception process may be initiated:

1. The development team must submit an exception request including:
   - Finding details
   - Business justification for exception
   - Compensating controls
   - Proposed timeline for permanent fix
   - Risk acceptance statement

2. The request must be approved by the appropriate authority based on severity

3. All exceptions must be documented and reviewed quarterly

### 7. Reporting

Security findings metrics will be reported in the following formats:

1. Daily summary of new findings to the security and development teams
2. Weekly status report to development management
3. Monthly trend analysis to security leadership
4. Quarterly summary to executive management

## Pipeline Integration

This procedure is integrated with the CI/CD pipeline through the following mechanisms:

1. Automated security scanning in the pre-build phase
2. Build failure for critical security findings
3. Security approval gates for production deployments
4. Automated notification of security findings
5. Audit logging of security events

## Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibilities |
